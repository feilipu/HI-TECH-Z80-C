This is a somewhat modified version of PIPEMGR.RSX by John Elliott.

PIPEMGR is an RSX which when attached to suitable programs provides input and
output redirection capability.  One possible use is to capture the output of
a program to a text file.  The DISKINFO tool supplied on Tesseract volume 89
is such a program.  So are pograms compiled with the updated Hi-Tech C from
Tesseract tvolume 91.

The archive contains TEE.COM which has the pipe manager RSX attached and so
behaves like its namesake in the UNIX world.

Version 1.03 of PIPEMGR reverts the last sector byte count to the
DOS Plus interpretation as the number of USED bytes.  To revert to
the Jon Saxton ISIS interpretation (number of UNUSED bytes) change
the conditional 'exact' to -1 and rebuild using MKRSX.SUB
